# Boot Animation & Login Screen Overlay

## Overview

This feature adds a Vista-inspired boot animation and login screen overlay to the portfolio website. The animation appears only on a user's first visit and completes within 5 seconds total.

## Features

### Boot Animation
- **First Visit Only**: Uses existing cookie functionality to show only on first visit
- **Vista-Inspired Design**: Frutiger Aero aesthetic with glass morphism effects
- **Animated Loading Bar**: Progress bar with scrolling blocks and status messages
- **5-Second Duration**: Complete sequence (boot + login) finishes in 5 seconds
- **Skip Functionality**: Users can press any key to skip the animation

### Login Screen
- **Interactive Form**: Username and password fields with validation
- **Demo Mode**: Any credentials will work for demonstration
- **Vista Styling**: Consistent with the overall site aesthetic
- **Smooth Transitions**: Animated transitions between states

### Sound Effects
- **Subtle Audio**: Optional boot and login sound effects
- **Non-Blocking**: Sounds don't delay the animation timing
- **Graceful Fallback**: Handles cases where audio isn't available

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- `BootAnimation.tsx`: Main boot animation component
- Integration in `app/page.tsx`: Added to main desktop component
- CSS styles in `app/globals.css`: Vista-inspired styling

### State Management
- Uses existing `isFirstVisit` state and cookie system
- `showBootAnimation` state controls overlay visibility
- `handleBootComplete` callback manages completion

### Cookie Integration
- Leverages existing `hasVisited` cookie functionality
- Sets cookie on completion to prevent future shows
- Respects user's previous visit status

## File Structure

```
app/
├── components/
│   └── BootAnimation.tsx          # Main boot animation component
├── page.tsx                       # Main desktop with boot integration
└── globals.css                    # Boot animation styles
```

## Configuration

### Timing (in BootAnimation.tsx)
```typescript
const BOOT_DURATION = 3000 // 3 seconds for boot
const LOGIN_DURATION = 2000 // 2 seconds for login
```

### Progress Steps
```typescript
const PROGRESS_STEPS = [
  { label: "Initializing system...", duration: 500 },
  { label: "Loading kernel modules...", duration: 800 },
  { label: "Starting services...", duration: 600 },
  { label: "Configuring network...", duration: 400 },
  { label: "Loading user interface...", duration: 700 }
]
```

## Integration Notes

### Non-Disruptive Design
- **Overlay Only**: Boot animation is a modal overlay that doesn't modify existing content
- **Read-Only**: No changes to existing pages, components, or functionality
- **Graceful Exit**: Smoothly transitions to the existing desktop interface

### Existing Functionality Preserved
- All existing windows, icons, and interactions remain unchanged
- Welcome window behavior is preserved
- Cookie system continues to work as before
- All existing features (Konami code, power menu, etc.) remain functional

## User Experience

### First Visit Flow
1. User visits site for first time
2. Black boot screen appears with animated loading bar
3. Progress messages show system initialization
4. Transitions to login screen after 3 seconds
5. User enters any credentials (demo mode)
6. Completion screen shows briefly
7. Transitions to normal desktop interface
8. Cookie set to prevent future boot animations

### Subsequent Visits
- Boot animation is skipped entirely
- User goes directly to desktop interface
- Welcome window behavior unchanged

### Skip Functionality
- Press any key during boot animation to skip
- Immediately transitions to desktop interface
- Cookie is set to prevent future animations

## Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation supported
- Screen reader friendly
- High contrast elements
- Clear visual feedback
- Skip functionality for users who prefer not to wait

## Browser Compatibility

- Works with all modern browsers
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Audio effects are optional and non-blocking
- CSS animations use standard properties

## Future Enhancements

- Configurable animation duration via props
- Multiple boot themes/styles
- Customizable progress messages
- Integration with user preferences
- Accessibility improvements based on user feedback
