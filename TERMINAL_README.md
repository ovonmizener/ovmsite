# Terminal Component Implementation

## Overview
A retro-style terminal component has been successfully integrated into the Next.js Vista-inspired portfolio site. The terminal provides a nostalgic command-line interface that can be launched from the Start Menu and offers various interactive commands.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Terminal Launch
- **Access Point**: Start Menu (click the Vista orb in the taskbar)
- **Menu Option**: "Terminal" appears in the Experience Menu
- **Window Type**: Draggable, resizable Vista-style window
- **Default Size**: 800x600 pixels

### 2. Retro Terminal Styling
- **Theme**: Dark background with green text (classic CRT look)
- **Font**: Monospace (Consolas, Monaco)
- **Cursor**: Blinking green cursor
- **Header**: Terminal-style header with window controls
- **Responsive**: Adapts to window resizing

### 3. Available Commands

#### Core Commands
- `help` - Display all available commands with descriptions
- `echo skills` - Display Oliver's technical skills (static data)
- `play game` - Launch a Snake mini-game in a modal window
- `whoami` - Display user information about Oliver
- `fortune` - Display random programming-related quotes
- `clear` - Clear the terminal history
- `date` - Show current date and time
- `ls` - List simulated files (portfolio sections)
- `pwd` - Print working directory

#### Snake Game Features
- **Controls**: Arrow keys to move the snake
- **Objective**: Eat red food to grow and increase score
- **Exit**: Press ESC to return to terminal
- **Restart**: Press Enter when game over
- **Scoring**: Points increase with each food eaten

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### Component Structure
```
TerminalWindow.tsx
├── Main terminal interface
├── Command processing system
├── History management
├── Snake game component
└── Retro styling
```

#### Key Features
- **Command History**: Use arrow keys to navigate previous commands
- **Auto-scroll**: Terminal automatically scrolls to show latest output
- **Error Handling**: Invalid commands show helpful error messages
- **Read-only**: Terminal only displays static data, doesn't modify site content
- **Self-contained**: Game launches in modal, doesn't affect main site

#### Integration Points
- **Window System**: Integrates with existing VistaWindow component
- **Taskbar**: Added to Experience Menu in vista-taskbar.tsx
- **Routing**: Added terminal case to WindowContent function
- **Styling**: Uses existing Vista theme classes

## Usage Instructions

### Launching the Terminal
1. Click the Vista orb (green/blue gradient) in the taskbar
2. Select "Terminal" from the Experience Menu
3. The terminal window will open with a welcome message

### Using Commands
1. Type commands in the input field at the bottom
2. Press Enter to execute
3. Use arrow keys to navigate command history
4. Type `help` to see all available commands

### Playing the Snake Game
1. Type `play game` and press Enter
2. Use arrow keys to control the snake
3. Eat red food to grow and score points

## Technical Details

### Command Processing
- Commands are parsed and executed through a command dictionary
- Each command has a name, description, and execute function
- Arguments are passed to command functions
- Results are displayed in the terminal history

### Data Management
- **Static Data**: All displayed information is hardcoded
- **No External Calls**: Terminal doesn't fetch from APIs
- **Read-only**: Cannot modify site content or state
- **Isolated**: Game runs in separate modal component

### Styling Approach
- **Retro Theme**: Dark background (#000000) with green text (#00ff00)
- **Vista Integration**: Uses existing Vista window styling
- **Responsive**: Adapts to window resizing
- **Accessibility**: Maintains good contrast and readability

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- `weather` - Display weather information
- `joke` - Tell programming jokes
- `matrix` - Matrix-style falling characters effect
- `pong` - Classic Pong game
- `calculator` - Simple command-line calculator
- `todo` - Personal todo list commands

### Technical Improvements
- Command autocomplete
- Tab completion for file paths
- Custom themes (different color schemes)
- Sound effects for retro feel
- More complex games (Tetris, Breakout)
